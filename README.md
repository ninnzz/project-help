## Setup

- Install poetry using the doc: https://python-poetry.org/docs/
- Use python `3.11` and above. It is recommended to use pyenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv for python version management

After installing poetry, make sure you are using the correct python version.

```shell
cd project_dir
python --version # Should output 3.11+
```

Run the notebook and create your own folder in the notebook directory.

`poetry run jupyter notebook`
